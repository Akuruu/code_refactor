# code_refactor
First BootCamp homework assignment on refactoring code titled 'Code Refactor'.

My objective is to refactor existing code from an example website that was provided in order to meet accessibility standards by replacing standard elements with semantic elements and organizing the CSS stylesheet, allowing it to be read easily. In this project, I will demonstrate the ability to group similar items together and edit html to be more likely to appear in search engines.
